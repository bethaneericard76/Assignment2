<p>NEW YORK, NY – A call for EMS can be the difference between life and death. EMS response times have increased in recent months, specifically between July and August 2024 and declined slightly by September 2024. However, the average response time across the three-month period was 17 minutes, as shown in the line chart below. This pattern is a result of several issues plaguing the agency, including the lack of additional resources, including nurses to weed out non-emergency 911 calls, and low starting salaries for EMTs. Oren Barzilay, President of FDNY EMS Local 2507 stated, “They can only do one assignment at a time. They are running across the city all day long, every day, 24 hours. Calls are coming in more rapidly in recent years, however, our resources has remained the same.” </p>
